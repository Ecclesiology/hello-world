My intentions are to build up the temple of Christ Jesus and to contribute toward His second advent by building up infrastructure to aid toward the Great Commission and to impact the lives of the Elect to the glory of His name.

"Zion says, 'The LORD has abandonded me;The LORD has forgotten me!'
'Can a woman forget her nursing child, or lack compassion for the child of her womb?
Even if these forget,
yet I will not forget you.
Look, I have inscribed you on the palms of My hands;
your walls are continually before Me.
Your builders hurry; those who destroy and devastate you will leave you.
Look up, and look around. 
They all gather together; they come to you.
As I live'--
                This is the LORD's declaration---
'you will wear all your children as jewelry, and put them on as a bride does.'"
--Isaiah 49:14-18
